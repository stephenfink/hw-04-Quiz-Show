# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz
This is a basic java script quiz with a timer and high score listing,
it lets a user input their name after the quiz is done and is then taken to a score page, 

Time is lost base on wrong answers, and Time is the score in which the faster one finishes the quiz the higher the score.

Thank you for your time.
